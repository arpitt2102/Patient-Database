# Patient-Database
A simple patient database management system for a hospital.
The purpose of this exercise is to help you get better understanding of some fundamental concepts in C that we covered after midterm. These include array of pointers, structures, pointer to structures, dynamic memory allocation, formatted IO.

# The program will provide several basic functions:
• Accepting entry of a new patient record into the current database, and generating risk factor for the patient.

• Displaying all patient records in the current database

• Removing an existing patient’s record in the current database

• Swapping the records in the current database

• Sorting the patient records in the current database

• Clearing the current database
